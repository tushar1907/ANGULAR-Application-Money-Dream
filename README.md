# Money-Dream
Welcome to the MEAN Stack boilerplate.
INTRODUCTION:
This application will help users to connect with other users for making money transactions.
There are basically two roles played by the user viz. Lender and Borrower .
The user can be either lender or borrower based on the type of role one chooses while they are in the application.
User can also add money in the personal wallet for transactions.
User will be able to see the transaction history after the login.

This is a SPA (single page application) boilerplate using the following technologies:

Technologies

MongooseJs
ExpressJs
AngularJs

Foundation
Foundation Icons
Quick Start
Install the following on your own

NodeJs



At the bin folder of mongo folder in bin path db => mondod
MongoDb

git clone https://github.com/tushar1907/Money-Dream.git
cd MDServer
npm install
cd MDClient
npm install

.
.
update the package.json file

At this point all your client-side code should be watching for changes.

If you have Supervisor installed... supervisor server

Supervisor will watch all of your server-side js and automatically restart your server everytime it detects a change.

If not

node server

You can now navigate to http://localhost:4200

Notice that you are automatically directed to the url http://localhost:4200 this is AngularJS's routing taking over.

Purpose
The MEAN Stack is designed to get you up and running with a modern web application very quickly.
